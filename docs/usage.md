Before using `shiori`, make sure it has been installed on your system. By default, `shiori` will store its data in directory `$HOME/.local/share/shiori`. If you want to set the data directory to another location, you can set the environment variable `ENV_SHIORI_DIR` to your desired path.

## Running Docker Container

> If you are not using `shiori` from Docker image, you can skip this section.

After building the image you will be able to start a container from it. To
preserve the data, you need to bind the directory for storing database and thumbnails. In this example we're binding the data directory to our current working directory :

```
docker run -d --rm --name shiori -p 8080:8080 -v $(pwd):/srv/shiori techknowlogick/shiori
```

The above command will :

- Creates a new container from image `techknowlogick/shiori`.
- Set the container name to `shiori` (option `--name`).
- Bind the host current working directory to `/srv/shiori` inside container (option `-v`).
- Expose port `8080` in container to port `8080` in host machine (option `-p`).
- Run the container in background (option `-d`).
- Automatically remove the container when it stopped (option `--rm`).

After you've run the container in background, you can access console of the container :

```
docker exec -it shiori sh
```

Now you can use `shiori` like normal. If you've finished, you can stop and remove the container by running :

```
docker stop shiori
```

## Using Web Application

To access web application, you need to have at least one account. To create new account, run this command :

```
shiori account add <your-desired-username>
