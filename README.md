Shiori is a simple bookmarks manager written in Go language. Intended as a simple clone of [Pocket](https://getpocket.com//). You can use it as command line application or as web application. This application is distributed as a single binary, which means it can be installed and used easily.

## Features

- Simple and clean command line interface.
- Basic bookmarks management i.e. add, edit and delete.
- Search bookmarks by their title, tags, url and page content.
- Import and export bookmarks from and to Netscape Bookmark file.
- Portable, thanks to its single binary format and sqlite3 database
- Simple web interface for those who don't want to use a command line app.
- Where possible, by default `shiori` will download a static copy of the webpage in simple text and HTML format, which later can be used as an offline archive for that page.
